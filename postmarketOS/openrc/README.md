### Table of Contents

This folder is about the OpenRC version of postmarketOS. OpenRC is legacy and will be replaced. I am not using this version anymore and keeping this folder only for documenation reasons. Systemd solves some of the issues this version has without additional effort. OpenRC images are available [here](https://github.com/pipa-project/postmarketos-builds) (see [Installation](install.md)).
